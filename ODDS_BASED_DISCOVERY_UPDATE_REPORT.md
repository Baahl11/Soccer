# Odds-Based Discovery System Update Report

## Overview
Recent improvements to the odds-based fixture discovery system focused on ensuring that only upcoming matches are returned, fixing issues with completed matches appearing in results.

## Key Changes

### 1. UTC Time Handling
- Changed to use `datetime.utcnow()` for consistent comparison with API dates
- All date comparisons now happen in UTC to match API response format
- Added proper handling of timezone information in match dates

### 2. Future Match Filtering
- Added strict filtering to ensure only future matches are returned
- Implemented 2-minute buffer to avoid edge cases with matches about to start
- Changed comparison operator to `match_date > now` for strict future-only filtering
- Improved date parsing with proper timezone handling:
```python
match_date = datetime.fromisoformat(match_date_str.replace('Z', '+00:00'))
match_date = match_date.replace(tzinfo=None)  # Convert to naive UTC
```

### 3. Error Handling Improvements
- Better handling of invalid dates
- Skipping matches with missing date information
- Proper error logging for date parsing issues
- Return empty list instead of unfiltered matches on error

### 4. Match Sorting
- Added date-based sorting of filtered matches
- Ensures matches are returned in chronological order
- Uses fallback date for invalid dates:
```python
filtered_matches.sort(key=lambda x: x.get('date') or '9999-12-31T23:59:59')
```

## Benefits
1. **Accuracy**: Only truly upcoming matches are now returned
2. **Reliability**: Better handling of edge cases and invalid data
3. **Consistency**: All time comparisons use UTC
4. **Organization**: Results are properly sorted by date

## Testing Results
- Successfully filters out completed matches
- Properly handles matches from different timezones
- Returns matches in correct chronological order
- Handles API response format correctly

## Remaining Considerations
1. Monitor API response times with the new filtering
2. Consider caching improvements for frequently accessed data
3. May need additional filtering for postponed/cancelled matches
4. Could add more detailed logging for debugging

## Usage Example
```python
# Get upcoming matches with odds
matches = get_matches_with_odds_24h(limit=5)

# Get verified matches only
verified = get_matches_with_verified_odds(limit=5)
```

## Dependencies
- datetime
- typing
- logging
- requests
- json
- pathlib

## Configuration
No additional configuration required. Uses existing API settings from config.py.
