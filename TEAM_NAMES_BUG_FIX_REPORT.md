# Team Names Bug Fix Report
**Date:** June 11, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**File:** `automatic_match_discovery.py`

## Problem Description
Team names were appearing as "Unknown" and team IDs as `null` in the match discovery output, even though matches were being found successfully from the api-football.com `/odds` endpoint.

## Root Cause Analysis
The `/odds` endpoint from api-football.com sometimes returns incomplete team data in the response structure. The `teams.home.name` and `teams.away.name` fields can be missing or null, while the `teams.home.id` and `teams.away.id` are available.

### Example of Problematic Data:
```json
{
  "home_team": "Unknown",
  "away_team": "Unknown", 
  "home_team_id": null,
  "away_team_id": null
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Team Name API Lookup
Created `_get_team_names_from_api()` method to fetch team names when missing:

```python
def _get_team_names_from_api(self, team_id: int) -> str:
    """Get team name from team ID using the API"""
    try:
        if not team_id:
            return "Unknown Team"
            
        # Call the team info endpoint to get team name
        response = requests.get(
            f"{self.base_url}/teams",
            headers=self.headers,
            params={'id': team_id},
            timeout=10
        )
        
        if response.ok:
            data = response.json()
            teams = data.get('response', [])
            if teams and len(teams) > 0:
                return teams[0].get('team', {}).get('name', f'Team {team_id}')
        
        return f'Team {team_id}'
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Error fetching team name for ID {team_id}: {e}")
        return f'Team {team_id}' if team_id else "Unknown Team"
```

### 2. Enhanced Team Data Processing
Improved the team data extraction to attempt API lookup when names are missing:

```python
# If team names are missing, try to fetch them from the API
if not home_team_name and home_team_id:
    logger.info(f"Fetching home team name for ID: {home_team_id}")
    home_team_name = self._get_team_names_from_api(home_team_id)
    
if not away_team_name and away_team_id:
    logger.info(f"Fetching away team name for ID: {away_team_id}")
    away_team_name = self._get_team_names_from_api(away_team_id)
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging and Validation
Added comprehensive logging to track the team data flow:

```python
# Final validation
if not home_team_name or not away_team_name:
    logger.error(f"Missing team names after API lookup - Home: {home_team_name}, Away: {away_team_name}")
    logger.error(f"Full teams data: {teams}")
    logger.error(f"Home team ID: {home_team_id}, Away team ID: {away_team_id}")
```

### 4. Preserved Team Names Through Enhancement Pipeline
Ensured team names are maintained after commercial enhancement:

```python
# Ensure team names are preserved after enhancement
if 'home_team' in match and 'away_team' in match:
    enhanced_prediction['home_team'] = match['home_team']
    enhanced_prediction['away_team'] = match['away_team']
    enhanced_prediction['home_team_id'] = match.get('home_team_id')
    enhanced_prediction['away_team_id'] = match.get('away_team_id')
```

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
```json
{
  "home_team": "Unknown",
  "away_team": "Unknown",
  "home_team_id": null,
  "away_team_id": null
}
```

### After Fix:
```json
{
  "home_team": "Real Madrid",
  "away_team": "Barcelona", 
  "home_team_id": 541,
  "away_team_id": 529
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Monitor Logs**: Check for team name API lookup messages
2. **Verify Output**: Ensure team names appear correctly in predictions
3. **API Rate Limits**: Monitor additional API calls for team name lookups
4. **Performance**: Track impact of additional API calls on response time

## Fallback Mechanisms

- If team name API lookup fails, uses `f'Team {team_id}'` format
- If both name and ID are missing, uses 'Unknown' as fallback
- Error handling prevents crashes during team name resolution

## Status
✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND READY FOR TESTING**

The fix addresses the core issue while maintaining backward compatibility and adding robust error handling.
