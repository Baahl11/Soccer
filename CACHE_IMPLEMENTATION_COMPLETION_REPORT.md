## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### 🏗️ **Cache Architecture**
```
CacheManager Class
├── File-based JSON storage in cache/ directory
├── Configurable TTL with automatic expiration
├── Thread-safe operations with file locking
├── Automatic cleanup of expired entries
├── Cache analytics and monitoring
└── Performance tracking with hit/miss counters
```

### 🔧 **Cache Integration Points**
1. **`discover_casino_matches()`**: 30-minute cache for match discovery
2. **`generate_predictions_for_matches()`**: 2-hour cache for individual predictions
3. **`get_todays_predictions()`**: 30-minute cache for complete results
4. **Cache keys**: Based on method name, parameters, and timestamp

### 📈 **Analytics and Monitoring**
- Real-time cache monitoring with status updates
- Cache usage pattern analysis
- Performance metrics tracking
- Automatic optimization recommendations
- Health monitoring and alerting
